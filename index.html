<h1>Text Formatting</h1>
<p>there are three main types of text formatting. those are <b>bold</b> <i>italics</i> and <u>underline</u>.</p>

<h2>inline vs block elements</h2>
<p> a <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. the paragraph and header elements are block elements. an <b>inline element</b>does not display its content on a new line. it keeps the content on the same line as the previous content. bold, italics and underline are all inline elements </p>


<h3>block elements examples</h3>


















<h1>attributes</h1>
<p><b>attributes</b>are properties which can change an html element. attributes are written in the opening tag of Any html element. the most common attributes are <i>src</i>,<i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i> and <i>style</i></p>

<h2>inline css styles</h2>
<p>the<i>style</i></p>

<p style="color:orangered">This paragraph has inline css style which changes the font color to orangered</p>
<p style="background-color:lightskyblue"

   <p style="color:lightskyblue; background-color:greenyellow">this paragraph has inline css style which changes the font color <b>AND</b> the background color.</p>

<p style="font-family:gothambook"></p> this paragraph has a different font type

<p style="font-size:48px"></p>

<h1 style="color:red">images</h1>
<p>an <b>image element</b>is an <i>inline</i>element which inserts pictures into the the document. an image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. it has one major attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images' location.those filepaths can either be <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b></p>

<h2>image attributes</h2>
<p>there are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text description of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over text to appear. </p>

<h3>width and height</h3>
<p>the width and height can be measured in many different ways, but the more common ones are pixels and percentages. using pixels,you set the specific, precise size based on pixels.using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page.in either case, setting the width alone respects aspect ratio, while setting both does not.</p>

<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/01/20/28/road-1072821__340.jpg" title="set width an height using pixels and respecting aspect ratio" width="50%"

 <h3>alt attribute</h3>
 <p>EVERY picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. the alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>
